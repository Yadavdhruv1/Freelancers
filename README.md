**FreelanceFinder** – Discover Your Perfect Freelancer

---

## 📝 Description

FreelanceFinder is a small yet functional React-based web application that allows users to browse and explore freelancer profiles. It simulates a mini freelance hiring platform where users can:
- View a list of freelancers
- Sort and filter them by skills, ratings, and price
- View detailed freelancer profiles
- Fill out a contact form to reach them

Data is fetched from a mock API, and the app uses clean UI design, state management, and React routing to ensure a smooth user experience.
